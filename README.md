Video-Grounded Dialogue Systems (VGDS)


Previous visual dialogue tasks focus on talking about a single static image between two agents in the conversation. However, we run into a sequence of images and audios in the real-world context, i.e. a video. Developing a dialogue system based on three different modalities: image, audio and text, is an interest topic.<br>

Talking to videos is a multi-modal dialogue task over video. Given a video includes a series video frames with audios, two agents can hold a meaning conversation in natural language.<br>
